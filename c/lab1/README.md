C Imperative Paradigm Lab – Starter Code (v2)

This starter code matches *exactly* the structure expected by
C_Imperative_Lab_Handout_v2.pdf.

Students should:
- Implement the TODO sections in main.c
- NOT change function signatures
- Answer reflection questions separately (or in comments if instructed)

Build:
  make
Run:
  ./main
